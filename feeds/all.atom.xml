"I haven't heard these songs" got me a stare, the eyes filled with shock and ridicule. A more generous person in the group asked me what music do I listen to instead. I couldn't answer that properly (I believe many of us are unable to), and probably also because I was sure the answer wont excite anyone there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is a good day, and I'd like to take a re-attempt at that question. I have been listening (and watching) MTV Unplugged Season 3 sessions on repeat since morning. Listen to the same song a 50 times, and you still find a piece that you missed noticing the last time. Also include MTV Coke Studio sessions from India as well as Pakistan. These shows have produced some of the most attention-consuming soundtracks in the last few years. Attention consuming like (an analogy) Sherlock, compared to other shows like BBT or F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Like Inception (and many others) amongst hollywood movies. Like what Madras Cafe was to Indian cinema and 24 to Indian Television, recently. These shows have the feeling of live music: they are recorded in one take, with real musicians, and give artists ample opportunity to showcase their creativity. This freedom to the artist is what makes "Music" out of "Songs". Sprinkle the collaboration word over, and it turns into Chicken Soup for the Music Soul! Everyone brings their palette of colours to the stage, from the backup vocalists to the solo instrumentalists to the main artists. Awesomeness lies in this experimentation, in this coming together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is experimentation behind bollywood music too, when they experiment with the hairstyle of the actor, the size of the actress's dress, or that eureka moment when they find the "munni" "sheila" or "tooh" of the next song! Congratulations :)
Every song will find listeners. But not every listener will find Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might not be able to answer "What music do you listen to, then?" when asked again. But I can sure share my list of favorites from these shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saari Raat, Noori&lt;/em&gt;, Coke Studio Pakistan, Season 2. After listening to Noori live at Seher, this song has been the most played on my player, and in my head. Each and every moment in this song is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S5U2GXKBSo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hallelujah, Karsh Kale ft Shilpa Rao&lt;/em&gt;, Coke Studio @ MTV Season 2. Amazing composition by Warren Mendonsa, Karsh Kale's rendition of the Leonard Cohen classic, and Shilpa's voice.&lt;br /&gt;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v11rpZgzOCk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Madari (Jamura), Vishal Dadlani&lt;/em&gt; Mtv Coke Studio Season 2. Vishal Dadlani and Sonu Kakkar. It is an amazing feeling to hear Vishal Dadlani singing songs like these, after having heard him with Pentagram.&lt;br /&gt;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-9s4nTLSdA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Khamaj, Shafqat Amanat Ali Khan&lt;/em&gt;, Coke Studio Pakistan, Season 2. The freedom of the artist I was talking about above. The "thairaav" in his voice can be witnessed here!&lt;br /&gt;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMF8npZN5wE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phir Le Aaya, Arijit Singh&lt;/em&gt;, Mtv Unplugged Season 3. This song! It deserved a format like Mtv Unplugged. And Arijit deserved this song too :)&lt;br /&gt;

more than three would you call fit and active. Above that, I am Punjabi, a beer 
lover, and I have spent most of my PT periods in school in the Music Room. In 
fact, the only thing constantly growing in my life since the last four-five 
years was my belly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, WAS. I will be running The Great Delhi Run tomorrow, which is a part of the 
Airtel Delhi Half Marathon, an Annual event for Delhites. I will be running 
about 6 kilometers, and this time I am not just hoping, I am sure that I will be 
able to complete the length of the race. Thanks to the spirit of this event, I 
am feeling better than my preparation. Also, over the last 2 months, I have very 
much learnt to believe in the Me vs Me ideology. Add to that the wonderful crowd 
of active and lively people, with whom I will match my steps tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start from JLN Stadium at 9.30 in the morning, while the 22 km event 
would have begun earlier. We will be running around the Lodhi Road area and this 
is gonna be a new experience for me as I have only been to jogging tracks of 
local parks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this aside, the thing that is making me really excited is the people I will 
meet, the new friends I will make. Quoting the speaker from runningandliving.com 
at the Get Active Expo last week, "Above all, have fun, have a good time". They 
also provided amazing guidance, and a checklist for participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's gonna be a challenge tomorrow, and I am sure I will get past it and come 
and write another blog post (this time with pictures)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, 9:30 AM, 6 kms. Cheer for me :D&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="fitness"></category><category term="running"></category><category term="delhi"></category><category term="marathon"></category></entry><entry><title>Six Weeks to Undo Sixth Semester's Sins</title><link href="http://blog.karanluthra.in/2013/06/six-weeks-to-undo-sixth-semesters-sins/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-17T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Karan Luthra</name></author><id>tag:blog.karanluthra.in,2013-06-17:2013/06/six-weeks-to-undo-sixth-semesters-sins/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Introductory paragraphs are supposed to be short, else the reader gets put off, 
they say! Mine was running long enough, so I made it the second one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently been called 'mugga' by my younger sibling! I have been called 
that every alternate day, for the last two weeks! I know I dint mug anything, 
just accepted my inability at producing what semester exams at my university 
expect from students (yes, took me a lot of time to figure this out), and then 
just tried to remain sincere with my plan. But that sincerity would zero down to 
frustration after most exams, when it seemed pointless to have gotten through 
all those books and notes, for the test was only about your ability to link the 
keywords in the question to the keywords you remember from the last 24 hours' 
preparation. Write a few points that could be 'highlighted' to qualify your 
answer correct. Now, to quantify your effort, fill sheets with what-so-ever crap 
you can think of. Yes, writing the question again is also acceptable!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now after all the junk, its time to feed some spinach to our minds! I have quite 
a list. So would all my peers. But, I'm gonna share it here. I have heard 
talking about it helps people stick to their plans, so lets try it this time! 
Here's a list of all that I hope to read, learn and do in the next six-eight 
weeks before college reopens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the most of my Summer Training: I admire my classmates who are coding for 
GSOC, or working at startups, or going to IITs or other research internships. 
Myself, I just wanna make the most out of what I got in hand, and I consider 
myself lucky for that. With my cousins help, I got an opportunity at 
TechMahindra, and I am really looking forward to having good exposure and a 
hard-working time there, irrespective of the project I will be assigned 
(tomorrow)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books to read: I will be travelling 2-4 hours everyday, and NOT driving, so 
i started off with Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design. Next up will be Steve 
Jobs biography by Karen Blumenthal. Lets finish these two, and I would have 
decided the next book by then :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogs to follow: I recently discovered two of my college seniors, (they 
don't know me) have quite a few good posts. Otherwise too, they both really 
command respect for their intellect, and I've subscribed to their blogs 
krspeak.wordpress.com and anupamguha.wordpress.com. There are a lot more seniors 
who inspire me, but that can become a future blog post!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already follow zenhabits.net and recently found zenpencils.com. There 
isn't much common other than the word ZEN and the motive to help readers. And 
this isn't a coincidence, but I really wanna figure out what ZEN really is, too. 
I will find other sources for that though. And articles about Taoism. One good 
option is to follow relevant groups and people on G+. (A blog post on G+ and its 
perks soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical articles/blogs: First, my brother had been telling me about ESR's 
philosophy during our chats in my study breaks, and I am starting with The Art 
of Unix Programming right away! Second, I had subscribed to Smashing Magazine 
don't know how long back, but never read it seriously! Whenever I can squeeze 
out time, I'll check it out in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To write/learn/code/research: I really find it interesting to observe how 
the masses perceive facebook. The most interesting part: most of us need to be 
much more aware and alert about what's good and what's not, about FB. After 
making the changes to my own profile, I'll write about what are the simplest few 
changes we can make to our FB usage. And my list of alternatives to facebook, 
for spending time online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, I am going to experiment a lot with the ideas I had during exams. Some 
of them are small enough to be a reason to learn web development, and a few 
might be big enough to be considered for my university project. But, lots of 
work needed here first of all!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew! I myself just figured out for the first time how much I had kept for 
post-exams, after compiling this list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing everything may seem unrealistic, but of course, I'll approach all these in 
little steps. I have been adding links, so that if someone finds any of them 
interesting, I have a partner to chat about something cool and of course, doing 
things together helps us achieve a lot more :) &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="internship"></category><category term="productivity"></category><category term="college"></category></entry><entry><title>Is it time?</title><link href="http://blog.karanluthra.in/2012/10/is-it-time/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-03T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Karan Luthra</name></author><id>tag:blog.karanluthra.in,2012-10-03:2012/10/is-it-time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is it time, for me to close my eyes?
To use the switch, to turn it off?
Seems like the closing of the eyes,
would only trigger a tear to fall
Seems like, taking a breather,
would only make me regret the call&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it time, to step aside?
To take the seat, and watch the game?
Seems like its a runway on tight schedule,
Take off, right now! Or else, dont blame.
Remind me of the player I wanted to be,
then anyone less, I wouldnt want to see!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="inspirational"></category></entry><entry><title>Gandhi, come to my college!</title><link href="http://blog.karanluthra.in/2012/10/gandhi-come-to-my-college/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Karan Luthra</name></author><id>tag:blog.karanluthra.in,2012-10-02:2012/10/gandhi-come-to-my-college/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Be the change you wish to see in the world", keh gaye hamare Dearest Gandhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuck it, who wants to read about what Gandhi said when he was alive? His 
picture on the Indian Currency says a lot everyday, every minute, for everyone! 
But these questions really bother me :
Why does today's leader very much wants Gandhi only in his pocket, and not even 
intend to incorporate, or even respectfully understand his ideals?
Why does it take so much to be pro-active?
Why do we let ourselves be anything less than perfect, at what we do?
Why don't we tackle the feeling of being incompetent every morning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this agitation started in the morning, when I started contemplating over how 
a particular technical festival in my college is being organized. I am an 
engineering student, and I have put my heart and soul since the past three weeks 
into getting sponsors for the events under my department. To clarify, my 
father's job designation or my mother's social status doesn't help me get money 
from investors. And I am proud of this part, that I pursue such jobs solely 
because I love adding some value to the organizations I am associated with. And 
I know that there are so many, so many people in the college who feel the same. 
But then, whats wrong? Why do we, as a group, always miss perfectionism by, say 
like the last few points? All this inspite of having many, many good leaders, in 
a crowd of others who are not true to even themselves!
I am lucky enough to sit at home on this national holiday, and ponder over these 
things. Most of us are probably holidaying in some shimla or mussourie, sitting 
fat over the bundles of Gandhi Currency notes we have been successful in 
accumulating.
And I am even luckier to have started off with Gandhi, I just came across a G+ 
update which quotes Gandhi ji saying “Anger and intolerance are the twin enemies 
of correct understanding”. And I totally believe that we need to BE THE CHANGE, 
so Ill start afresh, keeping aside all the anger and intolerance towards the 
TechFest situation :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let this be the thought for the day :
“ There are seven things that will destroy us :
Wealth without work, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, 
religion without sacrifice, politics without principle, science without 
humanity, and Business without Ethics”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen! :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="college"></category><category term="inspirational"></category></entry></feed>
