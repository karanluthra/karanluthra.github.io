There was nothing else one could be congratulated for on that night, except for GSoC results. As difficult as it was to believe I found it to be true that my proposal indeed got selected for the 10th &lt;a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014"&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;, for the summers of 2014. I will be working under &lt;a href="http://www.kde.org/"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/luthrak/5685265389584384"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; aims to improve how &lt;a href="http://trojita.flaska.net"&gt;Trojitá&lt;/a&gt; sends email over SMTP and make it as robust and capable as the IMAP part, the USP of the email client. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first contribution to Free and Open Source Software began with a &lt;a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=trojita.git&amp;amp;a=commit&amp;amp;h=6f14132d37666148e2db44be9e051816bb33daca"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; for Trojitá in February. It was a feature request that I thought I could work on, and while it took me very long to bring the patch to the quality that could get it merged, it was a different high I experienced when I heard "Ship It!" for the first time in my life, and saw my name in the 'About Trojitá' menu of the email client I had started loving to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="About Trojitá - List of Contributors" src="/images/trojita_authors.png" title="About Trojitá - List of Contributors" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reward of working with open source projects. You can imagine the impact your code can have on thousands (and millions? :D) of users and this motivates you to improve the patch each time it gets returned from a review by mentors. Another encouragement is that open source projects do not care about your exam scores, your university's reputation, or even your majors for that matter! I was thinking hard how to spend the summers after my final semester and before joining the job I have been offered through campus placement, and Google Summer of Code seemed like the dream option to me. However, I was never too sure about getting selected as I am not an experienced developer, so I kept exploring other options while planning to keep contributing to Trojitá at my own, slow pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did on the morning after the results night, was clear all the bookmarked interships! I have cleared most of the distractions by now, and got another &lt;a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=trojita.git&amp;amp;a=commit&amp;amp;h=7708aaa7fda2877a868a542e9a1335683c9cbdb7"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; submitted recently. I am still lagging behind schedule, but it's only going to get better from now :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are even one bit curious about how Open Source projects, GSoC, or Computer Science outside your exam-syllabus works, then keep watching this space. I will try and blog as much as I can about all that I am upto :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers to the Summer of 2014! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pelican?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will make this easy for those who write and read blogs made on Wordpress or Blogger. Pelican is a python program that takes as input your content written in plain text, processes it according to the configuration specified by you, and generates all the required HTML for each of your posts, pages and features. The processing step involves taking care of a lot of things like :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating the CSS by processing the Theme specified by the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building the structure of the web pages from plain-text documents (written in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" title="Wikipedia:Markdown"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText" title="Wikipedia:ReStructuredText"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizing the posts, pages and other content so that each resource is correctly addressed by the right URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doesn't Blogger do this for us anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it does. What it doesn't do is allow us to style our blogs using customized themes. I once had to edit a "blogger template" to make it look like what I wanted it to for a Birthday Wish book. Trying to make it float was a nightmare! &lt;em&gt;Lots&lt;/em&gt; of Ducktape and I dare not touch the EditHTML button again. Lesson learnt: Blogger doesn't like getting customized much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Blogger doesn't allow us to host our blogs anywhere else. I felt a little suffocated there. The difference between the time I started my Blogger blog and today is: Now I have my own VPS, I am using and learning to use Git and Github for a lot of things, and I am tired of being in the comfort-zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So what is under the hood?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am using &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;github-pages&lt;/a&gt; to host the static web-site generated by pelican. (other cool options: VPS, Dropbox!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am using the default 'notmyidea' theme, but I have been looking at &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes"&gt;other themes&lt;/a&gt; and will give a custom look to the blog soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The configuration files are version controlled and backed up at &lt;a href="https://github.com/karanluthra/blog"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Github repo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am using Markdown for structuring the content and I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; it! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am using three categories: Tech, Outdoors, and Misc. The use of tags is going to help readers really pick only what they want to read, as I couldn't convince myself to let the blog not be about &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; I do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How easy was to set all this up?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; for someone who had prior experience of using static website generators (Jekyll migrators?). It took me a little time to put all the pieces together, using two different configuration files, one for viewing on the local machine, and the other to publish/deploy. I didn't understand when and how to use the relative links setting, and had broken links for a long while. Another time consuming area was migrating the comments on each post. Blogger doesn't have cool "check out" options, and I had to go the long way of porting comments to Disqus first, and then make it fit the new slug and URL structure. But yes, if you're ready to move out of the Blogger/Wordpress comfort zone, I guess it is fair to let Pelican give you that tough time and the thrill of setting up everything yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end this post, I would say it was fun as well as beneficial to have left Blogger behind. Life is better when your blogs work according to you than you working according to Blogger. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migration will be easier than you think, right now. Let me know if you plan to switch. :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="blogging"></category><category term="github"></category></entry><entry><title>Six Weeks to Undo Sixth Semester's Sins</title><link href="http://blog.karanluthra.in/2013/06/six-weeks-to-undo-sixth-semesters-sins/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-17T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Karan Luthra</name></author><id>tag:blog.karanluthra.in,2013-06-17:2013/06/six-weeks-to-undo-sixth-semesters-sins/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Introductory paragraphs are supposed to be short, else the reader gets put off, 
they say! Mine was running long enough, so I made it the second one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently been called 'mugga' by my younger sibling! I have been called 
that every alternate day, for the last two weeks! I know I dint mug anything, 
just accepted my inability at producing what semester exams at my university 
expect from students (yes, took me a lot of time to figure this out), and then 
just tried to remain sincere with my plan. But that sincerity would zero down to 
frustration after most exams, when it seemed pointless to have gotten through 
all those books and notes, for the test was only about your ability to link the 
keywords in the question to the keywords you remember from the last 24 hours' 
preparation. Write a few points that could be 'highlighted' to qualify your 
answer correct. Now, to quantify your effort, fill sheets with what-so-ever crap 
you can think of. Yes, writing the question again is also acceptable!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now after all the junk, its time to feed some spinach to our minds! I have quite 
a list. So would all my peers. But, I'm gonna share it here. I have heard 
talking about it helps people stick to their plans, so lets try it this time! 
Here's a list of all that I hope to read, learn and do in the next six-eight 
weeks before college reopens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the most of my Summer Training: I admire my classmates who are coding for 
GSOC, or working at startups, or going to IITs or other research internships. 
Myself, I just wanna make the most out of what I got in hand, and I consider 
myself lucky for that. With my cousins help, I got an opportunity at 
TechMahindra, and I am really looking forward to having good exposure and a 
hard-working time there, irrespective of the project I will be assigned 
(tomorrow)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books to read: I will be travelling 2-4 hours everyday, and NOT driving, so 
i started off with Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design. Next up will be Steve 
Jobs biography by Karen Blumenthal. Lets finish these two, and I would have 
decided the next book by then :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogs to follow: I recently discovered two of my college seniors, (they 
don't know me) have quite a few good posts. Otherwise too, they both really 
command respect for their intellect, and I've subscribed to their blogs 
krspeak.wordpress.com and anupamguha.wordpress.com. There are a lot more seniors 
who inspire me, but that can become a future blog post!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already follow zenhabits.net and recently found zenpencils.com. There 
isn't much common other than the word ZEN and the motive to help readers. And 
this isn't a coincidence, but I really wanna figure out what ZEN really is, too. 
I will find other sources for that though. And articles about Taoism. One good 
option is to follow relevant groups and people on G+. (A blog post on G+ and its 
perks soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical articles/blogs: First, my brother had been telling me about ESR's 
philosophy during our chats in my study breaks, and I am starting with The Art 
of Unix Programming right away! Second, I had subscribed to Smashing Magazine 
don't know how long back, but never read it seriously! Whenever I can squeeze 
out time, I'll check it out in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To write/learn/code/research: I really find it interesting to observe how 
the masses perceive facebook. The most interesting part: most of us need to be 
much more aware and alert about what's good and what's not, about FB. After 
making the changes to my own profile, I'll write about what are the simplest few 
changes we can make to our FB usage. And my list of alternatives to facebook, 
for spending time online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, I am going to experiment a lot with the ideas I had during exams. Some 
of them are small enough to be a reason to learn web development, and a few 
might be big enough to be considered for my university project. But, lots of 
work needed here first of all!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew! I myself just figured out for the first time how much I had kept for 
post-exams, after compiling this list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing everything may seem unrealistic, but of course, I'll approach all these in 
little steps. I have been adding links, so that if someone finds any of them 
interesting, I have a partner to chat about something cool and of course, doing 
things together helps us achieve a lot more :) &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="internship"></category><category term="productivity"></category><category term="college"></category></entry></feed>
